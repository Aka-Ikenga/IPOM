Integrated Palm Oil Machine Model
This Project is about the development of a mechanistic model for the design of an Integrated Palm Oil Machine.
The model which is based on an already existing Integrated Palm Oil Machine can be used to produce different sizes of the same machine based on the required througput.
The throughput is the only required input to this model. The python programme will automate the process and return the dimension and sizes of the machine. Ultimatley it
will also be capable of producing CAD drawings of the machine.
The accepted throughput values is between 280 and 5650 kg/hr
